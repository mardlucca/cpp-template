# C++ Sample Project

This is a sample C++ Bazel project that can be used as a Git template repo for creating simple C++ 
libraries. Features include:
* Default .bazelrc configured for C++17 support.
* Google test support (see example under src/test/cc)
* Standardized folder structure (src/main/h, src/main/cc, src/test/cc, src/test/resources)
* Support for "test resource" files (under src/test/resources).
* Base .gitignore file ignoring default bazel output folders.
* Pre-configured to allow running/debugging in VS Code.
* Example usage of the library.
* BSD 3 License file. 
* Copyright snippets with BSD 3.


At this point this has only been tested in MacOS 12.
